{"id": "20250208_235819", "title": "scars are beautiful", "content": "scars are beautiful。\nCracks, like scars, tell a story. They are not only beautiful to look at, they are also lessons in survival and perseverance.\nThere is no learning, no victory, no good story without a share of failures, scars, and the perseverance it took to overcome them. Too often we overlook that idea in our perception of beauty.\nWabi-sabi does not have to be fatalistic. The appreciation of imperfection is not an invitation to let things break down and dilapidate. The opposite of fragility is not resilience. Some things become stronger or better when challenged by chaos and uncertainty.\nYour muscles become stronger as they heal from being torn by physical exertion. Products and systems can be designed to not only withstand aging, but improve over time.\nI find that much anxiety can be alleviated by finding beauty in transience, imperfection, and scars. If we feel judged for our scars, we become afraid to get scarred. We follow the path that results in the least amount of pain, rather than the path that leads to the most amount of learning.\nWhether they are literal or figurative, do not fear the scars. Be proud to earn them.
